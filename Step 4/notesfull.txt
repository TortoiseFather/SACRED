meeting 1:
passcom depends on the stock -> 
Weather isn't a safety issue
Communication between trains on parallel lines
Have to assume the track is clear regardless of visibility, concede a lot of autonomy to AWS
Safety can be controlled via infrastructure, safety in the moment is flexible
clapham rail is very important
car -> rail tech is transferrable, but not directly and needs to be filtered
fear of Dockland Light Rail
tech that drivers want -> a train that can communicate with passengers, can update stopping time and such on the fly, D.O.O
Class 700 series trains prevent wrongside door release
St Pancras someone fell on track and a driver spotted the person before the ATO
Every driver has at least one story where they have had to react to an out of domain event

meeting 2:
Driver Copetncy - Yardsticks 
Every train has a signaller
Damage to the train = risk object, large object or dense object
Cannot define a 'risk object'
Safety categorisation / filter out external factors (tresspass shouldn't count)
As long as everything meets standards, classification is of safe as baseline
Initial Cause -> Leading Cause -> underlying. Each case is investigated individually and it might be worth looking overall at the RSSB
Peterborough Incident - LUMO - Driver only had one route 186 times and one day had to run a new route, ran a level crossing on slow line
ETCS Focus in railway industry
BAE Heads up Display
camera reading road signs has a desire
Performance of ATO based on class 319 (old train) which led to problems. ATO sometimes takes decades to pay for itself
GoA yes
Driver Competency -> Rulebook knowledge, pass/fail exam. simulator stress tests, check data recorder for anomalies

(ASK) Every driver has at least one story where they have had to react to an out of domain event
2 fatalities -> deer / Staff working on line -> Bag of tools on line and 8 lines next to oneanother

meeting 3:
Out of distribution detection for the purpose of dividing risk categories.
Cause/Effect estimation

Classification of cause - Size, shape, collision probability
Effect - Classification of object, 

Meeting 4:
Questions for Vincent:
•What is the most common problem you face at work?
-Stuff that can't be dealt with locally, wider generic health/safety stuff
>Cab temperatures
Unable to focus if the temperature is uncomfortable, sometimes it can be disasterous temperatues of ~35c
Water ingress in older trains -> freezing
Signals Past At Danger (SPADS) current metric, SPADS->Working Environment
>Access to toilets
Uncomfortable shift times and lack of breaks, when they do get a break, it's often not at a station with a toilet/driver not allowed to abandon train
Knowledge of lack of toilet access results in lower water consumption, which leads to dehydration and lack of focus.

!Train being left alone within track environment is dangerous
!Fragmentation of companies stops wider infrastructure development

•What is the "worst" report you have had to handle?
!Stonehaven derailment
!Earthworks -> Tunnel where the ground has been dug, but they were dug 120 years ago, basically no maintenence, not built to current standards
!Embankments -> Raised earth, not built to current standards, climate change issues embankments

•In your email you mention crashworthiness of older trains, what does that mean exactly?
>Intercity 125/HST 80's trains that don't meet 2020's standards but are still used
!Impact Resistence
!Rigity around passengers
!Crumple zones
>Driver notices a tree on a track
!Once a driver notices something, it's too late
!Safety is fully conceded to signal officer, signal officer must notice tree on track before the driver
>Vegitation must be managed, can't get rid of vegitation as vegiation is required for embankments
!Line/Root proving procedure to determine stability -> Empty trains will run a route at low speeds after either engineering works or harsh weather
!Contact network rail to gather weather metrics -> Extreme weather task force

•What would you classify as a safety critical situation?
•What role do frontline workers play in identifying safety concerns?
>Safety of the line - Investigation by ORR after key accident
>Safety of the individual - Reported by individual or SPAD
SMIS -> Industry reporting tool -> Safety trends

•Can you discuss any technological advancements or innovations that have improved railway safety in recent years?
>Trains are non-transferrable, so there has been a push for uniformity of train classes
!Trains are not like cars, you need to not only know the route layout, you need to know the signal locations, the level crossing location, the pre-signal types, the station entry speed ect.
>Driver monitoring technology is always rejected
>Vision technology would be welcomed but is a low priority

•In a phrase, how would you define railway safety?
!Getting as few people as possible in cars
It's complicated
